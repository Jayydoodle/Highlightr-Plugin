### Ease of Use

Make beautiful highlights in your notes to supplement your note-taking workflow. The colors included were chosen to for universal use across themes, in both light and dark mode.

### How it Works

Obsidian app version 12.8 adds a powerful custom context menu for easier note-taking. This plugin adds 2 menu items: Highlight and Unhighlight. These menu items can only be seen on text selection. Clicking "Highlight" will trigger the highlighting modal, allowing you to choose from an assortment of colors. When you choose a color, your selected text will then be wrapped within HTML mark tags, including a color for the background that corresponds with the color you have chosen. Clicking "Unhighlight" will replace text that is within the string "<", "/>." That means that you can use this to remove HTML markings, and not just highlight marks.
